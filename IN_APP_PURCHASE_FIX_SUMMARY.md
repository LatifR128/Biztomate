# In-App Purchase Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Plugin Configuration
**Problem**: The `expo-in-app-purchases` plugin was not properly configured in `app.json`
**Fix**: Added the plugin configuration with proper iOS bundle identifier

```json
[
  "expo-in-app-purchases",
  {
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.biztomate.scanner"
    }
  }
]
```

### 2. Incorrect Purchase Flow
**Problem**: The original code was trying to query products before purchase, which was causing the "Product not available" error
**Fix**: Implemented proper purchase flow with:
- Product verification before purchase
- Proper purchase listener setup
- Timeout handling
- Better error handling

### 3. Missing Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error messages that didn't help with debugging
**Fix**: Added specific error handling for different scenarios:
- Product availability checks
- Network errors
- User cancellation
- Payment restrictions

### 4. Improved Initialization
**Problem**: Inconsistent initialization and connection management
**Fix**: 
- Better connection state management
- Proper cleanup on disconnect
- Connection verification before operations

## Key Changes Made

### 1. `app.json`
- Added `expo-in-app-purchases` plugin configuration
- Ensured proper iOS bundle identifier

### 2. `lib/inAppPurchases.ts`
- Improved `purchaseSubscription` function with proper flow
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Added product verification before purchase
- Implemented proper purchase listener management
- Added timeout handling for purchase operations

### 3. `components/InAppPurchaseTest.tsx`
- Created comprehensive test component for debugging
- Shows product availability status
- Allows testing individual products
- Provides detailed error information

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Product not available in store. Response code 0"
**Causes**:
1. Products not configured in App Store Connect

3. Testing on wrong environment (sandbox vs production)

**Solutions**:
1. Verify products are created in App Store Connect
2. Ensure app is configured for in-app purchases
3. Use sandbox testing account for development
4. Check bundle identifier matches App Store Connect

### Issue: "Purchase failed" with no specific error
**Causes**:
1. Network connectivity issues
2. App Store server problems
3. Invalid product IDs

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify product IDs match App Store Connect
3. Test with sandbox account
4. Check App Store Connect status

### Issue: Products not loading
**Causes**:
1. App not connected to App Store
2. Invalid product IDs
3. App Store configuration issues

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure proper initialization
2. Verify product IDs in constants
3. Check App Store Connect configuration

## Testing Steps

### 1. Development Testing
1. Use the `InAppPurchaseTest` component
2. Test with sandbox Apple ID

2. **App Configuration**:
   - Enable in-app purchases
   - Set up app-specific shared secret
   - Configure subscription groups

3. **Testing**:
   - Create sandbox testers
   - Use sandbox environment for development
   - Test with different scenarios

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Check Console Logs
The updated code includes comprehensive logging:
- Initialization status
- Product fetch results
- Purchase flow details
- Error information

### 2. Use Test Component
The `InAppPurchaseTest` component provides:
- Real-time status updates
- Product availability checking
- Individual product testing
- Detailed error reporting

### 3. Verify Configuration
- Check `app.json` plugin configuration
- Verify product IDs in `constants/subscriptions.ts`
- Ensure bundle identifier consistency

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** using the test component
2. **Verify App Store Connect** configuration
3. **Test with sandbox account** for development
4. **Deploy to TestFlight** for production testing
5. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues
