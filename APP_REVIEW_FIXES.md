# App Review Fixes - Biztomate Scanner

This document outlines all the fixes implemented to address the App Review issues for Biztomate Scanner.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. In-App Purchase Button Not Working
**Problem**: Purchase button exhibited bugs and no action occurred after tapping.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced Apple Pay implementation with proper in-app purchases
- Created `lib/inAppPurchases.ts` with proper App Store purchase flow
- Updated `app/payment.tsx` to use in-app purchases instead of Apple Pay
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/inAppPurchases.ts` (new)
- `app/payment.tsx`
- `constants/subscriptions.ts`
- `types/index.ts`

### 2. Mislabeled as Apple Pay
**Problem**: In-app purchase products were mislabeled as Apple Pay, confusing users.

**Solution**:
- Removed all Apple Pay references from UI and code
- Updated payment method labels to "App Store Purchase"
- Updated subscription screen to show "Secure App Store Purchase"
- Removed Apple Pay configuration from `app.json`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/payment.tsx`
- `app/subscription.tsx`
- `app.json`
- `lib/applePay.ts` (kept for reference but not used)

### 3. Missing Account Deletion
**Problem**: App supports account creation but doesn't include account deletion option.

**Solution**:
- Added account deletion functionality to settings screen
- Implemented `deleteAccount` function in auth store
- Added proper confirmation dialogs with clear warnings
- Ensures permanent deletion of all user data

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`
- `store/authStore.ts`

### 4. Missing Restore Purchases
**Problem**: App offers in-app purchases that can be restored but doesn't include a "Restore Purchases" feature.

**Solution**:
- Added "Restore Purchases" button to subscription screen
- Implemented `restorePurchases` function in in-app purchase service
- Added proper success/failure feedback
- Automatically applies highest tier restored subscription

**Files Modified**:
- `app/subscription.tsx`
- `lib/inAppPurchases.ts`

### 5. Receipt Validation
**Problem**: App needs proper server-side receipt validation for production apps.

**Solution**:
- Created server-side receipt validation service
- Implemented proper production/sandbox environment handling
- Added receipt validation after successful purchases
- Follows Apple's recommended approach for receipt validation

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/trpc/routes/receipt-validation/route.ts` (new)
- `lib/inAppPurchases.ts`
- `app/payment.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Details

### In-App Purchase Flow
1. User selects subscription plan
2. App checks in-app purchase availability
3. User taps purchase button
4. App processes purchase through App Store
5. Receipt is validated on server
6. Subscription is activated upon successful validation

### Account Deletion Flow
1. User navigates to Settings > Account
2. Taps "Delete Account"
3. First confirmation dialog appears
4. Final confirmation dialog with detailed warnings
5. Account and all data are permanently deleted
6. User is returned to authentication screen

### Restore Purchases Flow
1. User taps "Restore Purchases" button
2. App queries App Store for previous purchases
3. Restored purchases are processed
4. Highest tier subscription is automatically applied
5. Success/failure feedback is shown to user

### Receipt Validation Flow
1. Purchase completes successfully
2. Receipt data is sent to server
3. Server validates with Apple's production environment first
4. If production fails with sandbox error, tries sandbox environment
5. Server returns validation result
6. App activates subscription only if validation succeeds

## Configuration Requirements

- Product IDs must be configured in App Store Connect
- Shared secret must be set for receipt validation
